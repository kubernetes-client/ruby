## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes

**concurrency_policy** | **String** | Specifies how to treat concurrent executions of a Job. Valid values are: - \&quot;Allow\&quot; (default): allows CronJobs to run concurrently; - \&quot;Forbid\&quot;: forbids concurrent runs, skipping next run if previous run hasn&#39;t finished yet; - \&quot;Replace\&quot;: cancels currently running job and replaces it with a new one | [optional] 
**failed_jobs_history_limit** | **Integer** | The number of failed finished jobs to retain. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. | [optional] 
**job_template** | [**V2alpha1JobTemplateSpec**](V2alpha1JobTemplateSpec.md) |  | 
**schedule** | **String** | The schedule in Cron format, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron. | 
**starting_deadline_seconds** | **Integer** | Optional deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses scheduled time for any reason.  Missed jobs executions will be counted as failed ones. | [optional] 
**successful_jobs_history_limit** | **Integer** | The number of successful finished jobs to retain. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. | [optional] 
**suspend** | **Boolean** | This flag tells the controller to suspend subsequent executions, it does not apply to already started executions.  Defaults to false. | [optional]
